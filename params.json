The data send would be single char i.e.“1” which could be type casted and used to establish control over Arduino as follows:\r\n\r\nInt read;\r\nread=Serial.Read();\r\nif(read==48){\r\n//Write your Code for what to do\r\n}\r\n\r\nAbout the App Documentation can be found at this link:\r\nhttp://goo.gl/gPr1CE\r\n\r\nSample Arduino Source Code can be downloaded from this link:\r\nhttp://goo.gl/WpakUp\r\n\r\nI will be adding adding further functionality based on user reviews like accelerometer,GPS , PWM ,Serial terminal etc so if you have any specific need please do write an review.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
